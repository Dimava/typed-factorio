# FactorioTypes

Complete Typescript definition generator for the Factorio modding api, for use with [TypescriptToLua](https://typescripttolua.github.io/).

Currently WIP and in active development.

This project aims to provide type definitions for the Factorio API that are as complete as possible: no `any`s, minimal `unknown`s, correct nullability, and smart types.

The generator integrates both manual type definitions and the Factorio JSON api documentation introduced in factorio version 1.1.35.
